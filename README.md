# 💼 Digital Nurture 4.0 - Java Full Stack Engineering

This repository contains my **self-learning practice solutions** for the **Digital Nurture 4.0 – Java FSE (2026)** program powered by **Cognizant**. It includes exercises from both the **Upskilling** and **Deep Skilling** phases, following the structure and instructions given in the official handbooks.

- `ANSI SQL using MySQL`
- `Core Java`

### 🔹 Deep Skilling Phase
This advanced learning phase expanded into real-time, scalable backend and frontend development, covering:

- `Design Patterns & Principles`
- `Data Structures & Algorithms`
- `PL/SQL Programming`
- `Spring Core, Maven`
- `Spring Data JPA with Hibernate`
